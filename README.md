## Overview
The Interactive card details project is an frontend web project in which the task is to create an credit card and an form with some validations and when user clicks the confirm button the card details must updated to form user inputs.

  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ES6 
- DOM manipulation
- Form validation


### What I learned

This is a great project to check multiple conditions while validating a form, the most difficult part of this project is to check the format of the input values.
So, to check the format of the inputted string I have to learn regex, and it is really really tricky to grasp. I use regex to check that name must not contains any characters or any number and card number must not contains any character or letter.


### Continued development

The project is fully completed but When you enter the form confirm button, the details get updated and form section gets change to continue section and this section also has a button called 'continue' but nothings happens when you press this button so I want to create an banking dashboard so when user clicks on this button he will redirects to his dashboard where he/she can see all his details etc..


### Useful resources
